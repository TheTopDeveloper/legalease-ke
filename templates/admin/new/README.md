## How to Use

1. To use the new responsive admin interface, simply change your template paths from:
   ```
   templates/admin/page.html
   ```
   to:
   ```
   templates/admin/new/page.html
   ```

2. Include the new CSS stylesheet in your templates:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/admin-enhanced.css') }}">
   ```

3. For table views that need to be responsive on mobile, use the `responsive_table` macro from `responsive_card.html`:
   ```jinja
   {% from 'admin/new/responsive_card.html' import responsive_table %}
   {{ responsive_table(headers, rows, empty_message, empty_action) }}
   ```

4. For consistent card styling, use the `responsive_card` macro:
   ```jinja
   {% from 'admin/new/responsive_card.html' import responsive_card %}
   {% call responsive_card('Card Title', 'Subtitle', actions_html, 'icon_name') %}
     Card content goes here
   {% endcall %}
   ```

## Components

The new admin interface includes these reusable components:

- `layout.html` - Base layout template with responsive sidebar and header
- `responsive_card.html` - Collection of macros for responsive cards, tables, stats, etc.
- `dashboard.html` - Example implementation of a responsive dashboard

## Navigation

The responsive admin interface includes:

1. A full sidebar on desktop/tablet views
2. A collapsible off-canvas menu on mobile devices
